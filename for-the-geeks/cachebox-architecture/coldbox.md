# ColdBox

**class** : `coldbox.system.web.Controller`

A reference to a running ColdBox application context the CacheBox instance is running under. This will be null if running in standalone mode. However, if you are within a ColdBox application, the `CacheProvider` and its references can access anything within the running ColdBox application.
