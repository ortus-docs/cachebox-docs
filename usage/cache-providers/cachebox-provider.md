# CacheBox Provider

The CacheBox provider is our very own enterprise cache implementation that has been part of the core since its initial baby step versions. Our caching engine has matured over the years and it has been proven effective, fast, scalable and very user friendly. Here are the two implementations for our CacheBox provider:

1. `CacheBoxProvider` : Our base CacheBox provider caching engine
2. `CacheBoxColdBoxProvider` : A subclass of `CacheBoxProvider` that enables caching operations for ColdBox applications

| **FreeMemoryPercentageThreshold**  | numeric        | false    | 0                 | The numerical percentage threshold of free JVM memory to have available before caching. If the JVM free memory falls below this setting, the cache will run the eviction policies in order to cache new objects. (0=Unlimited) |
| **MaxObjects**                     | numeric        | false    | 200               | The maximum number of objects for the cache                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **ColdboxEnabled**                 | Boolean        | false    | false             | A flag that switches on/off the usage of either a plain vanilla CacheBox provider or a ColdBox enhanced provider. This must be true when used within a ColdBox application and it applies for the default cache ONLY.          |
| **resetTimeoutOnAccess**           | Boolean        | false    | false             | If true, then when cached objects are retrieved their timeout will be reset to its original value and thus elongating the survival strategy of the items. Much how session storages work.                                      |

### Eviction Policies

Coldbox ships with the following eviction policies

* **LRU** (Least Recently Used)
* **LFU** (Least Frequently Used)
* **FIFO** (First In First Out)
* **LIFO** (Last In First Out)
* **Custom**: You can also build your own and pass the instantiation path in this setting

### Object Stores

ColdBox ships with the following object stores:

* **ConcurrentStore** - Uses concurrent hash maps for increased performance
* **ConcurrentSoftReferenceStore** - Concurrent hash maps plus java soft references for JVM memory sensitivity
* **DiskStore** - Uses a physical disk location for caching (Uses java serialization for complex objects)
* **JDBCStore** - Uses a JDBC datasource for caching (Uses java serialization for complex objects)
* **Custom** : You can also build your own and pass the instantiation path in this setting

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please also note that each of the object stores can have extra configuration properties that you will need to set. So for that, let's delve a little deeper into object stores.
