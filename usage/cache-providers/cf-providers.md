# CF Providers

Our `CFColdboxProvider` is an implementation specifically written for Adobe ColdFusion 11 and beyond. This provider leverages the [EHCache](http://ehcache.org/) engine within ColdFusion 11 and extends the native ColdFusion capabilities by talking to the [EHCache](http://ehcache.org/) sessions natively via Java. In this manner we are able to do things like:

* Get extended cached object metadata
* Get overall cache statistics
* Talk to terracotta classes
* Do quiet operations on get, clear, and put
* Check if an element is expired
* Do reporting and content reporting
* Much more

## Properties

Each CacheBox provider can have its own set of configuration properties it needs for operation. Our CF providers also have some. Please note, all properties other than "cacheName" are passed through to the underlying EHCache implementation in ColdFusion. The default values may differ if you have edited the `ehcache.xml` file on your server.

> **Info** Please note that you can configure more than 1 `CFColdboxProvider` cache engine in your applications that can talk to more than one referenced ColdFusion (EHCache) custom cache.
