## CacheBox Manual - Version 6.x

![CacheBox](.gitbook/assets/cacheboxlogo.png)

CacheBox is a cache aggregator, in which you can aggregate different caching engines or types of the same engine into one single umbrella. It gives you built in logging (via [LogBox](http://logbox.ortusbooks.com)), an event model, synchronization, shutdown/startup procedures, reporting, interaction consoles and best of all a cache agnostic API.

**CacheBox is a standalone framework for ColdFusion (CFML) applications and it is also bundled with the ColdBox Platform.**
