# Scope Registration

CacheBox has a nifty little feature that enables itself to leech onto a specific scope in memory. It basically can auto-register itself in your environment with no further need for persistence or just to expand its location. By default CacheBox registers itself in application scope with a key of **cacheBox**, but you have complete control on how the scope registration should work.

## Customizable Keys:

| Key     | Type    | Required | Default       | Description                                               |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| enabled | boolean | false    | _true_        | Enable scope registration                                 |
| scope   | string  | false    | _application_ | The ColdFusion scope to persist on                        |
| key     | string  | false    | _cachebox_    | The name of the key in the ColdFusion scope to persist on |

Example:

```javascript
// The CacheBox configuration structure DSL
cacheBox = {
    scopeRegistration = {
        enabled = true,
        scope   = "application",
        key     = "cacheBox"
    },
};
```
